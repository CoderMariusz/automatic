# NOW / NEXT / LATER Framework
# Organizes epics by priority and dependencies
priorities:
  NOW:
    epics: ["epic-01", "epic-04"]
    stories: 15
    estimated_duration: "2 weeks"
    rationale: "Foundation epics with no blockers, highest business value"

  NEXT:
    epics: ["epic-02", "epic-03", "epic-05"]
    stories: 24
    estimated_duration: "3 weeks"
    rationale: "Depends on NOW epics, high business value"

  LATER:
    epics: ["epic-06", "epic-07", "epic-08"]
    stories: 48
    estimated_duration: "5 weeks"
    rationale: "Lower priority or blocked by NEXT epics"

# Risk Flags
# Stories requiring special attention
risks:
  - story_id: "epic-03.story-04"
    risk_level: "high"
    description: "Complex database migration with production data"
    mitigation: "Create backup, test on staging first, use feature flag"

  - story_id: "epic-07.story-02"
    risk_level: "medium"
    description: "Third-party API integration (unknown reliability)"
    mitigation: "Implement circuit breaker pattern, add retry logic"

# Critical Path
# Longest dependency chain (bottleneck)
critical_path:
  - "epic-01.story-00"
  - "epic-01.story-03"
  - "epic-02.story-00"
  - "epic-02.story-05"
  - "epic-05.story-03"

critical_path_duration: "3 weeks"

# Execution Recommendations
# Strategic guidance for Flow 3 execution
recommendations:
  - "Start with batch-01 (foundation stories with no dependencies)"
  - "epic-01 and epic-04 can run in parallel (no shared files)"
  - "Block epic-03 until epic-01 completion confirmed (database dependency)"
  - "Reserve senior-dev agent for epic-07.story-02 (high complexity, external API)"
  - "Consider feature flags for epic-05 stories (allows incremental rollout)"
