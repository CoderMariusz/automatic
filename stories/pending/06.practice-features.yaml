description: |
  Implement the interactive features of the Practice page, specifically the functional cards with buttons and a simulated modal interaction.
  This builds upon the layout established in story 05.

acceptance_criteria:
  - id: AC-1
    title: Functional Cards Display
    given: the page layout is ready
    when: the user views the 'Practice' and 'Study Materials' sections
    then: "the following cards are displayed with icons, titles, and descriptions as per the image: Mock Test, Topics, Mistakes Test, Hazard Perception Tests, The Highway Code, Know your Traffic Signs."
  
  - id: AC-2
    title: Interactive Buttons
    given: the cards are visible
    when: the user hovers over the buttons (e.g., 'View Topics', 'Start reading')
    then: the buttons should show a hover effect (e.g., slight color change or shadow).

  - id: AC-3
    title: Select Topic Modal
    given: the user is on the Practice page
    when: the user clicks the 'View Topics' button
    then: "a simple overlay/modal should open with the title 'Select Topic', displaying a list of topics (e.g., 'Alertness', 'Attitude', 'Safety and Your Vehicle') and a 'Close' button."

  - id: AC-4
    title: Modal Dismissal
    given: the 'Select Topic' modal is open
    when: the user clicks the 'Close' button or the background overlay
    then: the modal should close, returning the user to the main Practice page.

technical_notes:
  - Create a reusable Card component for the cards.
  - Implement the modal using a simple CSS-based overlay or a React/portal-like approach if applicable.
  - Data for topics can be hardcoded in a constant for this simulation.
